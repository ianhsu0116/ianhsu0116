# Hi, I’m Ian 👋

I’m a Master of Information Technology student at the University of Auckland and a former Software Engineer at Acer with three years of backend experience. I design and build event-driven services, APIs, automation, and data pipelines on AWS using TypeScript, Node.js, Terraform, and CI/CD. I started out as a self-taught developer, so I’m comfortable picking up new tools quickly and working end-to-end from idea to deployment.

I’m currently looking for graduate / junior roles (and internships) in New Zealand where I can help deliver scalable, reliable systems.
